comfort women project
This project is about comfort woemn. This website is an interactive and informative website where the user can explore and get an opportunity to learn 
more about this topic. This topic can be heavy to some people but it should not be ignored. This website includes images, articles, their voice, and my own
art piece that I made about comfort women. Butterfly is their mascot symbol so I chose that to be the main button. People are not educated on this topic 
and so many people know what it is vaguely but don’t know the actual stories of these women. There’s not much information or opportunities or space to 
educate themselves in history books. Hard to sift through all the information. I want people to recognize comfort women more and listen to their stories 
because people are acknowledging their struggles like the Japanese gov. Only recently are talking or bringing comfort women to light. Not just comfort
women during ww2 but all comfort women. With this website as a stepping stone I want people to open up to this topic and rememeber them. This is personally
very important to be because back when I was in Korea, we learned so much about comfort women at school and also it was always near us. It was easy to 
access and explore. I attened one of the protest that happened in Korea and that just set my mind strong. And that is the reason why I was so shocked when
I realized that in America the comfort women is not even mentioned in history textbooks. If so, maybe less than two paragraphs. I wanted to show the user
I am actually interested and have a strong opinon on this so that's why I added my own art work. I hope the user explore and dig deeper in this topic
after going through my website.
